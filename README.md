# Ex:forth
Ex:forth WILL BE a FORTH implementation based on
[pforth](https://github.com/philburk/pforth)
with the added ability to have C bindings.

## IT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPEMENT AND DOES NOT WORK
## I REPEAT, IT IS FAR FROM WORKING

### todo
- make including libs work
    - Windows support
- remake shell exec to match that of Gforth (getenv, GFORTHSYSTEMPREFIX)
- add Gforth-like binding gen syntax (in progress)
- rebrand user facing stuff
- some inclusion testing for edge cases
- DOCS
- missing standard extensions
    - search
    - doubble (kinda done (but not really))
    - facility (also has parts implemented)
    - tools (some missing)
    - xchar (maybe....)
- maybe add more Gforth words? (struct words, debug words...)
