# Ex:forth
Ex:forth WILL BE a FORTH implementation based on
[pforth](https://github.com/philburk/pforth)
with the added ability to have C bindings.

## IT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPEMENT AND DOES NOT WORK
## I REPEAT, IT IS FAR FROM WORKING

### todo
- make including libs work
    - current file tracking
- OS differencing words
- shell exec WORD
- DOCS
- add some error handling and sanity checks (what should they do?)
- add Gforth-like binding gen syntax
- maybe add more Gforth words? (struct words, debug words...)
